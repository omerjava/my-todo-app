# my-todo-app

- I made this little Javascript application a few months ago in Oct 2021.
- It was one of first JS application.
- I uploaded without refactoring, now it is quite messy. 
- It has a huge function in the JS file which handle everything :)
- After developing this todo app, I learned a lot in JS and writing clean code.
- To see my evolution of code writing, I uploaded without changing.
- I will refactor it soon!
